This module adds a "Reservation Summary Range" menu.
This menu opens a grid with a summary of the reservations over a date range.
For each day and room the table displays
- an empty green cell for a free room
- a red cell with the name for the guest if the room is busy
- a red cell with A and the checkin time on that day
- a red cell with D and the checkout time on that day
- a red cell with D/A if there are a checkin and a checkout on that day
- If the reservations are in draft state, the cells are orange.
